# KA-Huis Guides

This repository contains standardised practices that we use within our organisation. Information about our deployment process, used third party services and other types ofinformation will be placed here as well.

This project is created by four students from [Fontys Hogeschool](https://fontys.nl/) for a semester challenge:

* **Abas Sharif** - _Creator_ - [abassharif](https://github.com/abassharif)
* **Cyril de Wit** - _Creator_ - [cyrildewit](https://github.com/cyrildewit)
* **Mitch Kessels** - _Creator_ - [MiKessels](https://github.com/MiKessels)
* **Joey Vonck** - _Creator_ - [joeyvonck](https://github.com/joeyvonck)

The vision behind this documentation is to improve the overall collaboration between the various volunteers that contribute to our projects (ur project group currently, but hopefully the many that will follow). New contributors can easily start contributing by reading and following these guides. 

Feel free to contribute to these guides by introducing new guides or improvements to existing guides.
